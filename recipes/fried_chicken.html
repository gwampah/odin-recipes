    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <h3> Step 1 </h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3> Step 2</h3>
    <p>Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</p>
    <h3> Step 3 </h3>
    <p>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</p>
    <h3> Step 4 </h3>
    <p>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</p>
    <h4> Step 5 </h4>
    <p>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </p>
