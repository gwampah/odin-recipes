        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <p> Here's what you'll need to make this healthy chocolate protein ball recipe: </p>
        <h4>Rolled Oats</h4>    
        <p>Chewy rolled oats have tons of health benefits, including supporting heart and gut health. Plus, they're full of fiber that will keep hunger at bay for longer.</p>
        <h4>Peanut Butter</h4>
        <p>Protein-packed peanut butter helps bind the balls together. It creates a creamy texture and lends a nutty flavor. Almond or cashew butter would also work.</p>
        <h4>Honey</h4>
        <p>Honey adds sweetness without tons of added sugar. If you don't have honey on hand, try maple or date syrup.</p>
        <h4>Chocolate</h4>
        <p>This recipe calls for chopped dark chocolate, but you could use milk or semi-sweet chocolate if you prefer.</p>
        <h4>Flax Seeds and Chia Seeds</h4>
        <p>Flax seeds and chia seeds are packed with fiber and protein, making them the perfect additions to this healthy snack.</p>
        <h4>Protein Powder</h4>
        <p>Chocolate-flavored protein powder adds extra flavor and, obviously, takes the nutrient count up a notch.</p>
        <h4>Optional additions: </h4>
        <p>Shredded coconut, dried fruit (such as cranberries or raisins), chopped nuts (such as almonds or pecans), hemp seeds, spices (such as cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice)</p>
